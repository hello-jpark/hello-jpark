## 🌟 **About Me**

I am a passionate Data Engineer, Analytics and Business Intelligence Developer with 2+ years of experience transforming business needs into actionable, data-driven solutions across Finance, Operations, and IT. With my previous 4.5+ years of academic and industry experience in quantitative research and biomechanical analysis, I bring a unique foundation in extracting insights from complex datasets — from biomechanical data to enterprise business intelligence.

My journey began in the field of biomechanics, where I honed my analytical thinking through scientific inquiry and large-scale data analysis. This foundation naturally evolved into a career in data engineering, data analytics, and BI, where I now help organizations surface key insights and enable data-driven decision making.

I’m proficient in Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Azure, and Jupyter Notebooks, and have hands-on experience with building interactive dashboards, statistical models, ETL pipelines, and machine learning workflows.

I’m always open to connecting and collaborating on opportunities where data can drive meaningful change within an organization.
